# 📌 Description

**This project was created to practice and understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
It contains examples and exercises that demonstrate how core OOP principles work in real code.**

*The main goal of this project is learning, not production usage.*

# 🚀 Topics Covered

### In this project, I learned and practiced the following Java concepts:

- #### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
  - Classes
  - Objects
  - Contructions

- #### Inheritance

- #### Polymorphism

- #### Abstract classes and abstract methods

- #### Nested classes

- #### Anonymous classes

- #### Packages

- #### Method overloading

- #### Static modifier (static variables and methods)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to design classes and objects properly

- How inheritance helps reuse and extend code

- How polymorphism works through method overriding

- When and why to use abstract classes

- The difference between nested and anonymous classes

- How packages help organize large projects

- How method overloading improves flexibility

- How static works and when it should be used
### 🛠 Technologies

- Java

- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)

- Git & GitHub


### 📈 Purpose

***This repository is part of my learning journey and helps me build a strong foundation in Java for future studies and projects.***
